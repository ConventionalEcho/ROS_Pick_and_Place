## Description
<p>
  Using the code in this repository and the open source robot arm OpenManipulator a pick and place robot was designed. A laptop running       Ubuntu 16.04 with ROS kinetic installed was used. This repository was installed in ~/catkin_ws and build using "catkin_make". Using         moveit in rviz a simulation was created, collision avoidance was created by editing the .urdf file in open_manipulator_description. To     detect the blocks an logitech g920 camera was used. Using artrack_alvar the blocks equipped with the ar_tag_id: 0,1,2 were detected.
